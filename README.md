# Capstone Stock Market
Thorough investment analysis helps to see a company’s expenditures, its management’s efficiency in creating profits, and how positive the company's future prognosis is.   

The purpose of this analysis is to compile multiple datasets containing quarterly financial statements from publicly traded companies over a 5-year period (2015-2020), and create a model for determining the estimated value of a company based on its financial position using publicly available data.   The main goal of this analysis is to identify companies that are undervalued by the market, and whose share price is projected to increase in the future to make profitable investment decisions.

The stock market has reached record highs and is projected to continue increasing due to breakthrough innovations in Artificial Intelligence, 5G networks, and automation in manufacturing. There are thousands of companies trading on the stock exchange. Data allows an investor to find those companies that are in excellent financial health and exceed market expectations. Data-driven financial investment decisions may increase an investor’s potential earnings. 

# Motivation
I am hoping that answering the data questions will enable me to use the findings to make good investment choices.

# Data Questions
What are the top 5 financially strongest companies based on the quarterly Financial Statements reports (average price per share,  highest price per share, the lowest price per share, Price-To-Book (P/B) ratio, assets and liabilities, the amount of cash a company has, an amount of debt a company owes to lenders in the short term and long term, amount of cash a company generates, emerging competitors, a company’s management quality, what made those companies successful, a threshold of determining a financially strong company, a correlation between a company’s geographical location and its financial standing, actual and consensus earnings trends)? 

Does the data show a trend? 

Is it possible to forecast financial trends?
